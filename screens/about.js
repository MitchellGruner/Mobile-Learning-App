It allows professors to post courses, lessons, topics, documents (e.g. assignments), videos, and assessments all online. Users of Mobile Learning App create condensed online course material in hopes to replace some of the traditional time spent in the classroom.

          Mobile Learning App provides tools to support online learning in multiple ways. This can range from To-the-Point (TTP) video clips, to interactive online assessments. How a course is presented online depends on the content and complexity of the learning material, and the delivery methodology used by the instructor.
As with any classroom, it is a changing environment â€“ expect each module to apply different tools and techniques.
