# Mobile-Learning-App
A React Native application that allows “Subject Matter Experts” (SME) to post courses, videos, lecture notes, and quizzes to students who are 
currently enrolled in their course.  This application implements the Firebase Realtime Database to store user information.  The Student’s and 
SME’s credentials are also stored within the database.  This project was created by a group of six members who carried out their work in two-week 
long sprints in an Agile environment.

This project is the accumulation of two semesters of work at California State University, Sacramento, and was coded by six Computer Scienece majors;
this also served as our senior project.
